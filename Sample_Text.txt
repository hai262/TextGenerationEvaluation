Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a wise old owl. 
Every night, the owl would sit atop the tallest tree and observe the world below.
It saw children playing, merchants selling their goods, and travelers passing by.
The owl had a giftâ€”he could remember everything he saw.
The moonlight glowed softly as the wind rustled through the leaves.
One day, a young girl named Anna approached the tree.
"Wise owl, how can I learn to see the world as you do?" she asked.
The owl hooted and replied, "Observe, listen, and remember."

Machines learn to mimic language, patterns emerge, and meaning is constructed.
A Markov Chain assembles text sequences based on past observations.
Readability scores reveal how closely generated text mimics human complexity.
